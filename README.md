# Puzzle-GUI

As a final project for my Computer Science 112 class at Amherst, I created a GUI where you can play four different games: KenKen, Kakarasu, Skyscraper, and Strimko. The GUI allows you to switch between games easily and displays the solution if you ever give up. While the code is designed to find the solution to any instance of a game, currently there is only one instance of each game. An extension would be to randomly generate the board rather than have a set board.

To play simply compile all files and run the GameRun.java file.
